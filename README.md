This contact form was created when i was trying to learn the integration of backend with frontend. i.e. I needed to combine HTML, CSS, JS, Python anda Database.

I used the HTML and the CSS for the design.
The used the JS in defining the onclick event for the submit button of the form which is to display a response Message after the form has been submitted.
The app.by was to create models, database, render the index.html, and provide the route actions for the submit, index and the get_messages function.
The SQLAlchemy automatically created the database file in the instance folder without me having to do anything.
